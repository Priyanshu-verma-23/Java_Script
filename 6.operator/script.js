// Arthemetric Operator
// Example 1 : - 

const age = 19;
const jatinAge = 15;
console.log(age-jatinAge);

let a = 12, b = 15, c;
c = a+b;
console.log(c);
c=a-b;
console.log(c);
c = a*b;
console.log(c);
c=a/b;
console.log(c);
c=a%b;
console.log(c);
c=a++;
console.log(c);
c=a--;
console.log(c);

// a**b means a ki power b

console.log(2**4);

/*with the help of + operator we can join two or more string 
together*/
// Example : - 

let firstName = 'sahil', lastName ='verma';
console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);



// Assignment Operator

let x = 15, y = 2;
x = y;
console.log(x);
x += y;
console.log(x);
x -=y;
console.log(x);
x *= y;
console.log(x);
x /=y;
console.log(x);
x <<= y
console.log(x)


// Relational Operator

let firstNumber = 12, secondNumber = 3;
console.log(firstNumber>secondNumber);
console.log(firstNumber<secondNumber);
console.log(firstNumber>=secondNumber);
console.log(firstNumber<=secondNumber);
console.log(firstNumber==secondNumber);
console.log(firstNumber===secondNumber);

// Question 
/*1.If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many 
people would live in each half?
2.Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console.
3.Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?
4.The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have less people than the average country?
5.Based on the variables you created, create a new variable description which contains a string with this
 format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'.*/


// Solution 

let countryPopulation = 12;
console.log(countryPopulation/2);

countryPopulation++;
console.log(countryPopulation);

let finelandPopulation = 13;
console.log(finelandPopulation>countryPopulation);
